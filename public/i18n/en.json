When you install it, while the browser components are not shown, it still runs inside a browser. The reminders are saved in the browser's localStorage for the reminder.marcoparrone.com domain. localStorage works fine with Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers. Other browsers may delete localStorage after some time. Android by default uses Chrome, Windows by default uses Edge. Looping Reminder currently is not supported on Apple products. With the purpose to help to prevent the loss of the reminders, it is suggested to make a backup using the \"export\" functionality, every time you make some modifications that you don't want to lose.",
